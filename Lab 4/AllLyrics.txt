Woman, don't you know what I'm suffering from?
Ease my pain, make it wash on with the rain
Relieve me and put it up on your shelf
Take it away, and give it to somebody else

'Cause I know we're connected by love
Yes, I know we're connected, connected, connected by love
Yeah, I wanna be directed by your love
Connected by love

Friend of mine, you seem to know me best
You chose me out of all of the rest
Take me home with you, and help me forget
Let's take the worst and somehow turn it into the best

'Cause I know
We're connected, we're connected
We're connected by love
Yes, I know
We're connected, we're connected
We're connected, connected, connected by love
We're connected, we're connected
Yeah, I can't be rejected by your love
We're connected, we're connected

What have I done?
I have pushed away everyone
Help me forget
Let's put it all to bed
Forgive me, and save me
From myself
Don't forsake me, woman
And go and choose somebody else

'Cause I know
We're connected, we're connected
We're connected by love
We're connected
Yes, I know
We're connected, we're connected
We're connected, connected, connected by love
Yes, I'm infected, I need to be protected by your love
We're connected, we're connected
We're connected, we're connected
Connected, connected by love

Why does a dog need to be walked?
Three birds fighting out in the yard
But I don't know what they're fighting about
So why does a dog need to listen whenever you shout?

These cats seem to blow
Everyone's mind, but mine
What is so funny
About beasts above understanding?

Are you their master?
Did you buy them at the store?
Did they know they were a cure
For you to stop being bored?

So somebody mated them
And took their babies away from them
Stuck a price tag on their nose
And now you're buying it clothes

So why does a dog need to be walked?

Who's with me?

Who's with me?

Who's with me?

Yeah, I'm thinking about starting a corporation
Who's with me?
Nowadays, that's how you get adulation
Who wants to start a corporation?
I'm thinking about taking it all the way to the top
Who's with me?
Woo!
Yeah, I'm thinking about doing one giant drop
Who's with me?

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Woo!

Yes, I'm thinking about
Buying all the empty cars
And making one giant army
Who's with me?
I'm gonna buy up all the empty lots and make one giant farm
Who's with me?
Woo!
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about?
Woo!
Who's with me?
Woo! Woo!
Yeah, I'm thinking about starting a corporation
Who's with me?
And take it right to the top
Take it right to the top

These are my demands
I renounce wholeheartedly
In this extreme abjuration
That which I repudiate so vehemently
Adamantly unrepentant
Implacable and intractable
I abdicate with inexorable pleasantry
In this solemn refutation
This most earnest repudiation
I shall not negate
That which I state irrevocably
But I do it so gently
That you cannot resent me
For this humble request of my company
So with time left permitting
And while we're still sitting
May I please have another cup of tea?

Every sound I hear
Is louder than the last
Sounds like a dynamite blast
When you flick your teeth
I need a relief

Each one, each one
Louder than the last and
Makes my fingers curl
Sounds like a dynamite blast

Ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin'
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank
Ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin'
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank

Ain't nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank

Sip your drink
And I'll stop to think
That I'm the only one
Who can hear all the feasible world

Nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank

Ain't nowhere
Ain't nowhere
Nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank
Ain't nowhere
Ain't nowhere
Nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank
When you're robbing a bank

Nowhere to run
When you're robbing a bank

Hear me out, it ain't easy but I'll try to explain
Everything in the world gets labeled a name
A box, a rough definition, unaffordable
Who picked the label doesn't want to be responsible
Truth, you're the one who needs the keys to the prison
You create your own box, you don't have to listen
To any of the label makers, printing your obituary

Here's an example
If Joe Blow says "Yo, you think like Avagio"
You'll respond "No, that's an insult, Joe"
"I live in a vacuum, I ain't copy no one."
Listen up, son

Everyone creating is a member of the family
Passing down genes and ideas in harmony
The players and the cynics will be thinking it's hard
But if you rewind the tape, we're all copying god

Copying god, copying god
Copying god, copying god
Add your own piece, but the puzzle is god's

Paying interest on the bills, I'm late
But I just can't seem to remember the dates
I lay low and turn off the lamps
Come on over, you can lick the stamps and
We could put together a portfolio and
Sing hallelujah in stereo
If we find a baby, let her into the hall, but
Keep the car running on motor to go

We got fever and there ain't no cure, girl
Take out insurance if you ain't too sure, girl
We do things that lovers do, well
Never have to ever hear the rings of school bells
Plaid jeans, no cellular phone
All the time in the world, no twilight zone
My time is mine and they know they can't get
J. B. told me, you got to hit and he quitted

I'm never gonna go where you want me to go, 'cause
I got feelings that you just don't know and you can
Listen up if you want to hear
And if you can't stand it, then... right here

The name of the tune is Cool Hand Luke, 'cause
I got stripes on my pants and boots
In prison you can learn a lesson
From the hand alone to the hotbox session
Listen

The Sisyphean dreamer
My fibula and femur
Hold the weight of the world
Over and over
I think, therefore I die
Anxiety and I, rolling down a mountain
Over and over

My shoulder holds the weight of the world

Yeah, the wind is blowing
Volcanoes blowing, my lungs are blowing
Over and over
Who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
With no sign of a grave
Over and over
Over and over
Oh yeah

Hollow body
Wine belly perfidy
Move like Isotta Fraschini
Over and over
The rock 'n' roller, the young and older
Rolling back to the stroller
Over and over

And although you warned me
The gods have all scorned me now

The wind is blowing
Volcanoes blowing, my lungs are blowing
Over and over
Who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
With no sign of a grave
Over and over
Over and over

Over and over

And I'm punished for the passion
Only telling 'cause you're asking
And I'm a glutton for the tasking

And the lovers are drowning
And they're never gonna find 'em
'Cause theirs ego's gonna blind 'em
Over and over

Woo!

Yeah, my shoulder on a boulder
Holds the weight of the world
Yeah

Oh, the wind is blowing
Volcanoes blowing, my lungs are blowing
Over and over
Who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
With no sign of a grave
Over and over

My shoulder holds the weight of the world
Over and over
Over and over

The Sisyphean dreamer
My fibula and femur
Hold the weight of the world
Over and over
I think, therefore I die
Anxiety and I, rolling down a mountain
Over and over
Over and over

And although you've warned me
The gods have all scorned me now

Do you want everything?
Then you can have everything
What is everything?

Do you wish for nothing?
Then you will have nothing
Now that is something

Do you wanna see it all?
Well, you can just open your eyes
The one who is prepared, is never surprised

Do you wanna question everything?
Then think of a good question

Do you wanna start a fire?
Well you can watch it burn

Do you wanna learn?
Then shut up and learn

Do you wanna learn?
Then shut up
Shut up
Shut up and learn

Shut up and learn

She commands my respect
She commands my respect
And I can't recollect
I'm at a time in my life
She has all my respect
She has all my respect
And I cannot protect
My heart from her command

And she's stringin' me along
I'm 'bout to break, it's strong, so I can't detect it
She's comin' up behind me in the mornin'
Lovin' when I least expect it
Every single thing about this situation
Says I can't be wrong
And every time she gets her satisfaction
I want her to control me all night long

What melancholy magic
Has turned a multitude into mush
Mandibles drop from shock
An old lady at high altitude
Whispering hush
She slips off her white shoes
And grabs her tenor pacifier from its stand
Thirty half steps to the microphone
Smile on her face
Flower in her hand
Oh how a crowd can melt
When they've been dealt
Such a deliciously delicate blow
By a barefooted fairy
Not with a clang but a whisper
Totally stealing the show
Fools desire distraction
And not take to heart
Their faces to their gadgets fall south
Ignoring the beauty of a fog on a hill
And a kitten with a mouse in its mouth
A motley mob settles down
And there's hardly a frown
As the air in the temple turns to mist
A spotlight, a mark and a cleanse of the throat
And her microphone gently is kissed
You can hear a boot lace
And a speck of dust taste
As the babe bravely stared down the herb
But she played not a note
And only one moment spoke
These simple and poignant five words
You people are totally absurd

I've been walking down by the river
For hours
Past sailors, that house
Less tattoos than the average teenager
There's a man fishing
And selling what he catches
A dollar a head
I've been sitting near you
For a long time now
And he's yet to look over
I have a strange feeling
That I know this man
That it's me
I think it's me

Let's try it
Can you hear me now?
Am I invisible to you?
Out of the blue now
Out of the blue now

Can you hear me now?
Am I invisible to you?
Get in the mind shaft

Can it be? Can it be?
Can it be? Can it be?

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Can you hear me now?
Get in the mind shaft
Get in the mind shaft
Come inside
Come inside
Can you hear me now?
Deep inside me, now

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Get in the mind shaft
Can you hear me now?

What's done is done
I just can't fight it no more
So, I'm walking downtown to the store
And I'm buying a gun

This just ain't no fun
My life has become a bore
Pasin' back and forth on the floor
Thinking of someone

Why do I feel that nothing is real
And nobody is there to hear?
Something goes wrong and I can't hear the song
That you used to sing in my ear

What's done is done
I just can't fight it no more
So, I'm walking downtown to the store
And I'm buying a gun
Yeah

Why do I feel that nothing is real
And nobody is there to hear?
Something goes wrong and I can't hear the song
That you used to sing in my ear

What's done is done
I just can't fight it no more
So, I'm walking downtown to the store
And I'm buying a gun

Either you go or I go
And it won't be me

Strains of humoresque divine
You thrill and fill this heart of mine
With gladness like a soothing symphony

Over the air, you gently float
Into my soul, you strike a note
Of passion with your melody

Sunbeams are playing
Flowers and trees are swaying
Captured within your magic spell

If the children are dancing
Lovers are all romancing
Is it any wonder, everyone is singing?

Strains of humoresque divine
You thrill and fill this heart of mine
With gladness like a soothing symphony

Over the air, you gently float
Into my soul, you strike a note
Of passion with your melody
